#  Project Description 

This project presents an interactive Excel dashboard designed to analyze customer experience and delivery performance across leading quick-commerce platforms such as Instamart, Zepto, Blinkit, JioMart, and Swiggy Instamart. With the rapid growth of on-demand delivery services in India, evaluating customer satisfaction and operational efficiency has become critical for business decision-making. This dashboard leverages Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and Slicers to transform raw data into meaningful insights.

The dashboard focuses on multiple dimensions of customer experience. Firstly, it compares average ratings across agents and platforms, providing a clear view of service quality. A separate analysis highlights the impact of discounts on customer ratings, showing how price incentives influence satisfaction. Secondly, the dashboard visualizes average delivery time by location, helping identify cities where service speed is strong versus those requiring improvement.

In addition, the dashboard measures order accuracy across product categories such as food, grocery, essentials, electronics, and pharmacy. Accurate orders directly influence trust, making this a crucial KPI for evaluating service consistency. Another key component is customer feedback sentiment analysis. Feedback is categorized into positive, neutral, and negative responses, with results showing a slightly higher proportion of negative reviews. This provides actionable insights for platforms to enhance service reliability and customer support.

To enhance usability, the dashboard integrates interactive slicers for filtering results by location, order type, price range, and customer feedback type. This functionality allows stakeholders to drill down into specific scenarios and compare performance across multiple perspectives. For instance, a user can quickly filter by city or product type and instantly see updated results across all visuals.

Overall, this dashboard demonstrates how Excel can be used as a powerful business intelligence tool, even without advanced analytics software. By consolidating key performance indicators into a visually engaging and user-friendly format, it supports quick decision-making and performance monitoring. The project not only showcases technical skills in data visualization but also reflects an understanding of customer behavior and operational efficiency in the highly competitive quick-commerce industry.
